Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## 5. Java 注释约定

1. **创建 Java 源文件时必须添加详细的 Javadoc**。深度按契约分量分级：承载行为契约、并发保证或协议可见语义的类与方法按 JDK `Lock` 接口级撰写（类级：职责、线程模型、状态机、契约边界；方法级：分支语义、判定顺序、幂等性、调用者义务）；简单访问器与数据载体保持简洁，不制造深度。私有方法、私有构造器与私有字段同样必须有 Javadoc（`maven-javadoc-plugin` 已配置 `show=private`，缺失即构建失败）。
2. **任何 Java 源文件的变更必须同步修改对应的 Javadoc**。行为变化时注释一并更新，保持"只读注释即可懂契约"；注释语义以代码实现为准，写注释前先读懂代码。
3. **对外源码注释与发布元数据禁止引用内部过程文档**。发布模块 `src/main` 全部注释/Javadoc 与模块 `pom.xml` 的 `<description>` 不得出现内部过程材料与代号（《设计说明书/概要设计/详设》及 §x.y 节号、Phase N、任务号 P1-NN、任务家族代号 T/S 族、里程碑 M 族、design D[0-9] 决策号、openspec change 名与 spec"XX" 引用）；引用删除后注释须只读自洽，纯修订跟踪句整句删除。门禁：`bash scripts/check-source-citations.sh`（命中即非零退出并定位 file:line，模式集以脚本头注释为准单一事实源；`--selftest` 校验模式集夹具，提交前自查与 CI 共用）。
